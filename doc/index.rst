RAT (is an Analysis Tool) User's Guide
======================================
This manual describes how to configure and run RAT for simulation and analysis.
Those who wish to modify the source code of RAT should first be familiar with
this guide, then read the Programmer Guide.

RAT-PAC (RAT, Plus Additional Codes) is hosted on
`GitHub <https://github.com/rat-pac/rat-pac>`_. For information on accessing
and working with the code using Git and GitHub, see
:download:`Using GitHub with RAT-PAC Code <github_guide/ratpac_github.pdf>`.
