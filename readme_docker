In this current implementation, any branched merged into the master version of the github will automatically be 
uploaded to the docker image.

The correct work procedure is to fork the repository to your personal directory. Make required changes. Make pull request
by assigning a approved custodian.

Please note that another github exist for WATCHMAN work: AIT-WACTHMAN/watchmakers. Within that github are tools to
call docker image functions from the users terminal.
